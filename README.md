## Flowchart
This is how the application works.
1. You provide the transaction details such as the amount to be transferred and the recipient account information. Once complete, you click 'Send'

2. In the backend, a deposit is made from your StarkBank account to the StarkDOL reserve pool equivalent to the desired transfer amount

3. Following the deposit, the backend mints an equal amount of StarkDOLs to uphold the stability of this token, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Here is the StarkDOL icon:

4. To bypass intermediaries, the newly minted StarkDOLs are used to facilitate the transfer to an account in a designated exchange, which could be in another country

5. Upon receipt, the exchange automatically converts the StarkDOLs into US dollars, which are then transferred to the recipient account in the other country

6. Below is a flowchart for visualizing this process. It's important to note that the end-user doesn't need to understand the underlying process; they only experience the cost-saving benefits of using our service!

## Requirements

1. `npm install`
2. `npm install -g @quasar/cli`
3. `quasar dev`


## Usage
### User Interface
1. As a StarkBank client, you enjoy access to various services on their platform. To conduct international transactions, simply click on the "International Transactions" option. Here, a user-friendly interface will prompt you for essential details like your Bank Agency, Bank Account, and the dollar amount you wish to send. With a single click, the transaction begins, and a confirmation pop-up appears upon completion

2. To enhance transparency, you may utilize our API to scrutinize and audit the reserve pool and the volume of tokens in circulation. It's important to maintain a balance where each StarkDOL in circulation corresponds to a dollar in the reserve pool. To visualize this functionality, visit our front-end for a live demonstration
